Sibrary boyue g10 firmware ver. G10-0723

Since I have boyue G10 eink reader, it happend to me twice already to make it unusable. It simply didn't boot.
I found original site to be really slow for firmware to download and without any english documentation, so here it is:

1. Charge readeruntil battery is full
2. Download all update-sd.zip.* files and unzip them to update-sd.img
3. Format some sd card to FAT (not FAT32)
4. Put update-sd.img on sd card
5. Shut down reader and insert sd card
6. hold power and joystick button down togheter for about 5 seconds or more
7. Update screen should appear, then don't press anything and just wait antil full boot

##Happy reading!##
